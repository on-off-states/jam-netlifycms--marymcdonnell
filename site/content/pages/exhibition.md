    <p>As the forms of artistic output are diverse, so too are the sites of display. Commissioned pieces (textile wallhangings, mixed media works) for site specific installation and can be found on display in museums, heritage site visitor centers, banks, libraries, cafes as well as private homes, both in Ireland and further afield.</p>
    <p>Many exhibitions involve the bringing together a local group and setting a theme for making work: founder of local textile and art groups: Drogheda Quilters, Indigo, Alchemy, Ceangailte; active member of the Irish Patchwork Society and the Embroiders Guild; former owner of a Craft Shop and Gallery in Slane, Co. Meath for over 10 years, where the public could see her process of textile production in situ.</p>
    <p>Current exhibitions are drawing on local Slane history and genealogical archives, often contributing to and participating in the commemoration of historical events of local and national significance, particularly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centenary_of_the_Easter_RisingCentenary"> Commemoration of the 1916 Rising</a> and of the 1917 WW1 death of Slane Poet, <a href="http://www.francisledwidge.com/">Francis Ledwidge</a>.</p>

    <p><cite>The Letter</cite> presents a new body of work that revisits the memory of a story told about a cherished piece of family memorabilia: the artist remembers her father, Ray Cogan, speaking about the letter written to him by his grandmother, Elizabeth Callery, congratulating him on his plan for marriage. <!-- (mm-slane exhibition letter artwork. jpg) --></p>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>Research into other archives has provided material for experiments in technique and visual composition that imagine the life and times of a mother of fourteen children at the turn of the century, who originally came from Oldcastle. This process of research has involved activities such as making a quick sketch of the farmhouse in Ballinacree, outside Oldcastle, believed to have been the birthplace of Lizzie Callery, and subsequently proven not to be the case. Had the artist not assumed this to be the case, she would not have created a series of pieces based on the peeling paint interior that she found inside the derelict house. (all other images: mm-slane exhibition process: process house photo.jpg; process sketcher.jpg; process house sketch.jpg; process house interior. jpg)</p>
    <p>The site of display of the artworks, incorporating family archives, opens the genealogical research to the possibilities of collecting new information from the public, both locally based and from further afield.</p>
