  <p>Growing up in a household that encouraged resourcefulness and using things to hand, fed creative exploration through art and craft, and led to teacher training as a home economics secondary school teacher.</p>
  
  <p>As a mother of four children, techniques in needlecraft, knitting, pottery, weaving, fabric dying were applied in various projects from making clothing to soft furnishings to decorative objects. Customization of traditional techniques through a unique personal twist became a signature of artistic output from early on.</p>

  <p>This continues now to form a core element of a distinctively generous approach to teaching adults in various situations: one that focuses on demystifying the art making process; opens up possibilities in the everyday for finding subjects to observe and render in artistic representation; stimulates the creative imagination while sharing practical skills, technique and know how.</p>
