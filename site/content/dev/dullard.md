  <h3>Archetypes</h3>
  <p>Belatedly recognising more fully the differences between victor-hugo and default new hugo site directory structure. victor-hugo has separate child /site dir whereas default hugo has the default site directories at project root. And archetype directory for default.md is missing. This content file in /content/dev/ section created after adding /archetypes/default.md to establish default front matter.<p>
  <h4>Example archetype yaml/toml</h4>
  <p>(Need to check how to format code in markdown)</p>

  <p>Last toml example is current default.md front matter Iâ€™ve used here to create this content file.</p>
  <p><strong>Re DRY:</strong> in addition need to establish refactoring for common section file markup.</p>
