  <p>Growing up in a household that encouraged resourcefulness and using things to hand, fed creative exploration through art and craft, and led to teacher training as a home economics secondary school teacher.</p>
  <p>Innovative customisation of traditional techniques in needlecraft,knitting, pottery, weaving, dying in the making of clothes, soft furnishings and decorative objects formed the basis early on for  a playful, open and cross fertising art practice rooted in the everyday of family life. This continues now as a core element of a distinctively generous approach to teaching adults in various situations: one that focuses on demystifying the art making process; opens up possibilities in the everyday for finding subjects to observe and render in artistic representation; stimulates the creative imagination while sharing practical skills, technique and know how.</p>

Customization of traditional techniques through a unique personal twist became a signature of artistic output from early on.</p>
