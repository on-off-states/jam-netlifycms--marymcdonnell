      <description>Teaching  Growing up in a household that encouraged resourcefulness and using things to hand, fed creative exploration through art and craft, and led to teacher training as a home economics secondary school teacher.
Innovative customisation of traditional techniques in needlecraft,knitting, pottery, weaving, dying in the making of clothes, soft furnishings and decorative objects formed the basis early on for a playful, open and cross fertising art practice rooted in the everyday of family life.</description>
